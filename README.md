# Countdown

A web application to help you keep track of the number of days left for your events.

## Development

Clone this repository, `cd` into it, and run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.

To see the application in action on your local browser:
1. Run `yarn start` in the application directory to start the development server.
2. A new tab will automatically be opened on your browser with the application running. The default port is `3000`.
3. As the application persists data to the local storage of your browser, you can safely close and restart the application and still have all your data intact. 

To make a production build, run `yarn build`.

## Credits

This project:
1. Looks great (hopefully) because of [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).
2. Was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
